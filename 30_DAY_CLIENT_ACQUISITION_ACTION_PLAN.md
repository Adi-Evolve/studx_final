- Batch similar activities together (all calls, then all meetings)

- Keep track of what works and what doesn't

### **Week 3: Conversion**

- Create urgency but don't be pushy
- Celebrate small wins to maintain motivation

### **Week 4: Scaling**
- Document processes while they're fresh in your mind
- Ask for referrals as soon as clients see value
- Plan for Month 2 while managing Month 1 clients
- Stay focused on client success, not just revenue

**Remember: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistent daily action beats sporadic intense effort every time!** 🎯
