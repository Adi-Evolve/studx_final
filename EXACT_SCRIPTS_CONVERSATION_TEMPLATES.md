## **SCRIPT 1: COLD CALL TO HOSTEL OWNER**

### **Opening (First 15 seconds)**
```
"Hello, is this [Owner Name]?

Hi sir, good [morning/evening]. This is [Your Name] from StudX. 

I hope I'm not calling at a bad time?

[Wait for response]

Sir, I help hostel owners get more student inquiries through online marketing. I was in your area yesterday and noticed your hostel - it looks like a really good place for students.

Can I ask you one quick question that will tell me if I can help you or not?"
```

### **Hook Question (Next 30 seconds)**
```
"Sir, how many rooms do you currently have empty?

[If they say 0]: That's fantastic! You must be doing something right. But let me ask - how long does it typically take when a student moves out to find a replacement?

[If they say 1+]: I thought so. Most hostel owners I talk to have 2-5 rooms empty at any given time. 

Sir, each empty room is costing you ₹8,000-10,000 per month, right? So if you have 3 empty rooms, that's ₹24,000-30,000 lost revenue every month.

What if I could show you how to fill those rooms 50% faster?"
```

### **Value Proposition (Next 45 seconds)**
```
"Sir, I work with a platform called StudX where students come when they're actively looking for rooms. Instead of waiting for students to find you through word of mouth, we bring the students directly to you.

Here's what happens:
1. When a student searches 'rooms near [college name]' on their phone, YOUR hostel appears FIRST
2. They can see your room photos, facilities, and rent instantly  
3. They contact you directly when they're ready to book
4. You only pay when you actually get results

The best part? I can prove this works with a completely FREE trial for the first month.

Would you be interested in seeing exactly how this works? I can show you on my phone - it takes just 5 minutes."
```

### **Meeting Request (Final 30 seconds)**
```
"I'm in your area tomorrow [day] evening. Would 6 PM or 7 PM work better for you? I'll come to your location and show you exactly what students see when they search for rooms.

[If hesitant]: Sir, it's completely free to see the demo. If you don't think it can help your business, no problem at all. But if it can help you fill even one room faster, isn't it worth 5 minutes?

[Confirm]: Perfect! So that's tomorrow [day] at [time] at your hostel. Can I get the exact address? And what's the best number to reach you if I need to confirm?"
```

## **SCRIPT 2: FOLLOW-UP CALL (After Initial Contact)**

### **Opening**
```
"Hello [Owner Name], this is [Your Name] from StudX. We spoke yesterday about helping you get more student inquiries for your hostel. How are you doing today?

[Brief pleasantries]

I wanted to follow up because I was thinking about what you mentioned - that you have [X] rooms currently empty and it usually takes [Y] weeks to fill them."
```

### **Value Reinforcement**
```
"Since we spoke, I've been working with another hostel owner in [nearby area] who had the exact same situation. He had 4 empty rooms for over 2 months. 

Within 3 weeks of starting with us, he filled all 4 rooms and now has a waiting list. That's ₹32,000 extra revenue he wouldn't have had otherwise.

I'd love to show you exactly how we did it. Are you free this evening around [time] for that quick demo I mentioned?"
```

### **Objection Handling**
```
If "I'm busy": "I completely understand sir. How about I just send you a quick WhatsApp video showing what students see when they search for rooms in your area? Takes 2 minutes to watch, no meeting required."

If "I need to think": "Of course sir. But while you're thinking, those empty rooms are still costing you money every day. What if we start the free trial while you think about it? No risk, no payment required."

If "Too expensive": "I haven't even told you the price yet sir! But let me ask - what would it be worth to you to fill those empty rooms 2-3 weeks faster? Even one room filled faster pays for our service for 6 months."
```

---

## **SCRIPT 3: FACE-TO-FACE MEETING**

### **Opening & Rapport (2 minutes)**
```
"Thank you for your time sir. Your hostel looks really nice - I can see why students would want to stay here. How long have you been running this place?

[Listen and engage]

And you mentioned on the phone that you have [X] rooms total with [Y] currently empty. What's your biggest challenge in finding good students for those rooms?"
```

### **Problem Agitation (3 minutes)**
```
"Let me ask you a few questions:

1. When students move out, how do you typically find new ones?
2. How long does it usually take to fill an empty room?
3. What's the longest a room has stayed empty?
4. Are you worried about the new PGs opening nearby?
5. Do you think students look online for rooms these days?

[Listen carefully to each answer]

So if I understand correctly - you're losing ₹[X amount] every month on empty rooms, it takes [Y weeks] to fill them, and you're mainly depending on word of mouth while students are searching online. Is that right?"
```

### **Demo Presentation (5 minutes)**
```
"Let me show you exactly what students see when they're looking for rooms. 

[Open phone/tablet]

This is StudX - when students search 'rooms near [college]', they see these results. 

[Scroll through listings]

See these hostels? They're getting 20-30 inquiries per month just from this platform. But notice - your hostel is not here. Students can't find you.

[Click on a sample listing]

Look at this - students can see room photos, facilities, rent, distance from college, and contact the owner instantly. When they're ready to book, they call or WhatsApp directly.

Now imagine YOUR hostel appearing right here at the top with a 'FEATURED' badge. Every student looking for rooms in this area would see you first.

[Show analytics mockup]

And you can track everything - how many students viewed your listing, how many contacted you, which days are busiest. Complete transparency.

What do you think?"
```

### **Addressing Objections (3 minutes)**

#### **"Too expensive"**
```
"I understand cost is important sir. But let me put this in perspective:

Empty room cost per month: ₹8,000
Our service cost per month: ₹2,000
Your profit when we fill that room: ₹6,000

And remember - first month is completely FREE. You pay only if you see results. 

Plus, if we help you fill rooms even 2 weeks faster than usual, you've already made back the cost for the entire year."
```

#### **"Students already know us"**
```
"That's great sir! It shows you have a good reputation. But let me ask - do ALL students know about you? 

Every month new students join college, existing ones graduate, transfer, or move out. They all start by searching online.

Even if 70% of students know you, what about the other 30%? That's potential business going to your competitors who ARE online.

We're not replacing your word-of-mouth marketing - we're adding to it."
```

#### **"Don't trust online marketing"**
```
"I respect that sir. Many successful business owners are cautious about new things.

But let me ask - where do YOU go when you need anything? Don't you check online first?

Students are the same. In fact, they're even more online than we are.

That's why I'm offering a complete guarantee - first month FREE, and if you don't get at least 3 serious inquiries, you pay nothing. What do you have to lose?"
```

### **Closing (2 minutes)**
```
"So sir, based on what I've shown you, do you see how this could help fill your empty rooms faster?

[Wait for agreement]

Great! I have two options for you:

Option 1: We start with the basic package at ₹1,500 per month - guaranteed top placement when students search for rooms
Option 2: Premium package at ₹2,500 per month - includes social media promotion and priority customer support

Both come with the FREE first month trial. Which one sounds better for your needs?

[If hesitant]: Or we can start with the basic package and upgrade later if you want more features. What do you think?

[When they agree]: Perfect! Let me get the agreement ready. When would you like me to start setting up your profile? Tomorrow or day after tomorrow?"
```

## **SCRIPT 4: HANDLING DIFFICULT CLIENTS**

### **Scenario: Hostile/Suspicious Owner**
```
OWNER: "Are you here to sell me something? I'm not interested in any marketing."

YOU: "I understand your concern sir. I'm sure you get a lot of sales people. But let me ask you this - are those rooms behind you currently occupied?

[Point to any visible rooms]

Because if they're not, you're losing money every single day. I'm not here to sell you anything - I'm here to help you make money.

Can I ask - what's the most frustrating thing about finding good students for your rooms?"

[Let them vent, then]:

"Exactly! That's the exact problem I solve. And I'm so confident I can help that I'll work for you completely FREE for the first month. If I can't get you at least 3 serious inquiries, you pay nothing.

What do you have to lose except empty rooms?"
```

### **Scenario: "I'll think about it"**
```
"Of course sir, this is an important decision. 

But let me ask - while you're thinking, what's your plan for those empty rooms? Are you going to wait for students to magically appear?

Here's the thing - every day you delay is money lost. Even if you think for just one week, that's ₹[weekly loss] gone forever.

Why not start the free trial while you think about it? If you decide you don't like it, you can cancel anytime. But if it works, you'll wish you started sooner.

What makes more sense - losing money while thinking, or potentially making money while thinking?"
```

### **Scenario: "My nephew will handle marketing"**
```
"That's wonderful sir! It's great to have family involved in the business.

But let me ask - does your nephew have experience specifically with online marketing for hostels? Because this is very different from general marketing.

We work with students every day. We know exactly what they search for, when they search, and how they make decisions. 

Even if your nephew learns all this, it will take months. Meanwhile, your competitors are already online getting those students.

Plus, we can work together with your nephew. In fact, he might learn a lot by seeing how professional online marketing works.

Would you like me to include him in our discussion? I'm happy to explain everything to both of you."
```

## **SCRIPT 5: SUCCESS FOLLOW-UP (After First Month)**

### **Performance Review Call**
```
"Hello [Owner Name], this is [Your Name] from StudX. I hope you're doing well.

I'm calling to review your first month's performance. I have your numbers here and I think you'll be very happy.

In the last 30 days:
- [X] students viewed your hostel listing
- [Y] students contacted you directly
- [Z] room visits were scheduled
- [A] bookings were confirmed

That's ₹[amount] in new revenue directly from the platform!

How has your experience been so far? Any feedback for me?"

[Listen to response]

"I'm so glad to hear that! Based on these results, I'd love to continue working with you. 

For next month, I'm thinking we can optimize your listing even further. I noticed students are searching for [specific terms] - we can adjust your profile to capture more of those searches.

Shall we continue with the same package, or would you like to upgrade to premium for even better results?"
```

### **Referral Request**
```
"Sir, I have a request. As you can see, our service really works. You've gotten [X] inquiries and [Y] bookings in just one month.

I'm looking to help 2-3 more hostel owners in this area. Do you know any other PG owners who might be struggling with empty rooms?

If you refer someone and they become a client, I'll give you one month free service. Plus, you'll be helping a fellow business owner make more money.

Is there anyone who comes to mind?"
```

---

## **SCRIPT 6: EMERGENCY OBJECTION HANDLING**

### **"I can't afford it right now"**
```
"I completely understand sir. Cash flow is important for any business.

But let me ask - can you afford to keep losing ₹[amount] every month on empty rooms?

Here's what I can do: Start the free trial today. If you get even one booking in the first month, use that rent money to pay for our service. You're essentially using our results to pay for our service.

And if you don't get any bookings, you pay nothing. You literally cannot lose money on this deal."
```

### **"I need to discuss with my partner/wife"**
```
"Of course sir, that's very wise. Important decisions should be discussed.

Would you like me to explain everything to both of you together? I'm happy to come back when your [partner/wife] is available.

Or I can prepare a simple summary sheet that shows exactly what we do and the guaranteed benefits. You can show that to [partner/wife] and we can talk after.

The important thing is that you both understand how this can help your business. When would be a good time for all of us to meet?"
```

### **"Students don't use phones for this"**
```
"I understand why you might think that sir. But let me ask - do you have a smartphone?

[Yes]: And when you need to find anything - a restaurant, a shop, directions - where do you look first?

[No]: Well, your students definitely do. And just like you might ask friends for recommendations, they look online first, then ask friends.

In fact, let me show you something. 

[Open Google on phone]

See this? I'm searching 'hostels near [college]' - look how many results come up. Students are definitely searching online.

The question is - do you want them to find your competitors, or do you want them to find you?"
```

---

## **QUICK RESPONSE CHEAT SHEET**

### **For Any Hesitation:**
```
"Sir, let me ask you this - what's the worst that could happen if you try our free trial?

Best case: You get 5-10 new inquiries and fill your empty rooms
Worst case: You get nothing and pay nothing

Even if there's just a 20% chance this works, isn't it worth trying when it costs you nothing?"
```

### **For Time Pressure:**
```
"I understand you're busy sir. That's exactly why you need this - so students can find you automatically without you having to chase them.

The 5 minutes we spend setting this up could save you hours of time looking for students later."
```

### **For Any Price Objection:**
```
"Sir, what's more expensive - ₹2,000 per month for guaranteed inquiries, or ₹8,000 per month loss on every empty room?

We're not a cost - we're an investment that pays for itself with just one booking."
```

**Remember: Confidence is key. Believe in the value you're providing, and clients will believe in it too!** 🎯
